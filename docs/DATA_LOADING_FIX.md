# Data Loading Issues Fix

## Problem: No Data Loading in Dashboard

The dashboard was showing "Failed to load" errors for events, agents, and other data even though:
1. The API Status page showed "Connected" 
2. The mock API server was running and had data
3. The API paths were corrected in previous fixes

## Root Causes and Solutions

1. **Inconsistent API Request Methods**
   - **Issue**: Some components were using `fetch` directly while others used the `apiClient`
   - **Solution**: Standardized all API requests to use the `apiClient` with the correct paths

2. **URL Format Mismatch**
   - **Issue**: Components were constructing URLs manually with formats different from the API
   - **Solution**: Converted all manual URL building to use the parameter objects with `apiClient`

3. **Response Data Structure Mismatch**
   - **Issue**: Components expected data in format `data.alerts` but API returned `data.items`
   - **Solution**: Updated all components to use the correct data structure with `.items`

4. **Pagination Format Differences**
   - **Issue**: Components expected data structure like `pagination.currentPage` but API returned `page`
   - **Solution**: Updated pagination handling to match the API structure with `data.page` and `data.total`

5. **Missing API Endpoints in Mock Server**
   - **Issue**: The mock server was missing endpoints for `/events/:id` and `/alerts/`
   - **Solution**: Added all necessary endpoints to the mock server

## Added Debugging Features

1. **Enhanced API Client Logging**
   - Added detailed request and response logging in the API client
   - Each request now logs its URL, method, and parameters
   - Each response logs its status code and data

2. **More Detailed Error Handling**
   - Improved error messages to include specific details
   - Added fallback handling for various error types
   - Fixed `[object Object]` display in error messages

## Testing the Fix

1. Start the mock API server:
```bash
npm run mock-api
```

2. Start the Next.js development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Check the browser console for request logs
4. Verify data is loading in all dashboard components

## Further Improvements

1. **API Service Layer**
   - Create dedicated service functions for each data type (agents, events, etc.)
   - Handle caching and request deduplication in the service layer

2. **Error Boundaries**
   - Add React error boundaries around key components
   - Create fallback UI for component failures

3. **Mock Data Enhancement**
   - Add more diverse test data to the mock server
   - Create random data generators for development
