# Performance Optimization Guidelines

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the Cylestio Monitor dashboard and provides recommendations for maintaining high performance as the application grows.

## Implemented Optimizations

### Database Optimizations

1. **Improved SQLite Configuration**
   - Enhanced WAL journal mode settings
   - Optimized page and cache sizes
   - Configured memory-mapped I/O (mmap_size)

2. **Database Indexing**
   - Added indexes on frequently queried columns
   - Added indexes to support joins between tables
   - Created script (`npm run db:create-indexes`) to set up indexes

3. **Query Optimization**
   - Implemented caching for database queries
   - Added prepared statement caching
   - Optimized JOIN operations

### UI Performance Improvements

1. **Virtualization**
   - Implemented virtual scrolling for large data tables
   - Only renders visible rows for better memory usage

2. **Data Fetching**
   - Added API response caching
   - Implemented selective data fetching with pagination
   - Added cache invalidation strategies

3. **Rendering Optimization**
   - Memoized component calculations
   - Enhanced loading indicators for better user experience

## Performance Best Practices

### Database Queries

1. **Use Pagination**
   - Always paginate large result sets
   - Keep page sizes reasonable (25-50 items)

2. **Minimize Joins**
   - Avoid complex joins where possible
   - Consider denormalizing data for performance-critical paths

3. **Use Caching Strategically**
   - Cache frequently accessed, rarely changing data
   - Implement proper cache invalidation when data changes

### Component Optimization

1. **Virtualize Large Lists**
   - Use virtualization for lists with more than 100 items
   - Set appropriate overscan values (10-20 items)

2. **Manage Component Re-rendering**
   - Use React.memo for pure components
   - Implement useMemo and useCallback for expensive calculations
   - Use stable references for objects and functions

3. **Lazy Loading**
   - Lazy load components not needed for initial render
   - Consider code-splitting large components

### Data Loading Patterns

1. **Selective Loading**
   - Only fetch data needed for current view
   - Implement progressive loading for details

2. **Optimistic Updates**
   - Update UI optimistically before API calls complete
   - Handle rollbacks gracefully if API fails

3. **Real-time Data**
   - Use polling with increasing intervals for less critical data
   - Consider WebSockets only for truly real-time features

## Monitoring Performance

1. **Client-side Metrics**
   - Track component render times
   - Monitor memory usage patterns
   - Identify slow operations

2. **Server Metrics**
   - Track query execution times
   - Monitor database locks and contention
   - Measure API response times

3. **User Experience Metrics**
   - Track time to interactive
   - Monitor user-perceived latency
   - Gather feedback on UI responsiveness

## Future Optimizations

1. **Advanced Caching**
   - Implement service worker caching for offline capabilities
   - Consider Redis or Memcached for shared server-side caching

2. **Database Scaling**
   - Plan for database sharding strategy
   - Consider read replicas for heavy read workloads

3. **Code Splitting**
   - Implement route-based code splitting
   - Split vendor bundles by page/feature

## Benchmarking

To evaluate the performance of the application, run benchmarks regularly using:

1. Chrome DevTools Performance tab
2. Lighthouse audits
3. Custom performance tracking in the application

Document performance changes over time to track improvement or regression.
