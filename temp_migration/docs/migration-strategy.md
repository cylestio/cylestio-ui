# Cylestio UI: Database to API Migration Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for migrating the Cylestio UI dashboard from direct database connections to the new Mini Local Server API. The migration will be executed in a phased approach, focusing on one component at a time to minimize disruption and ensure quality.

## Migration Goals

1. Replace all direct database access with API calls
2. Maintain existing functionality where supported by the API
3. Add new features enabled by the API where appropriate
4. Ensure proper error handling and loading states
5. Improve overall code maintainability

## Architecture Changes

### Before:
- UI components directly query SQLite database via repositories
- Database connection managed in UI codebase
- Complex SQL queries embedded in repository classes

### After:
- UI communicates via REST API to Mini Local Server
- Server handles database access and query logic
- UI focuses on presentation and user interaction
- Standardized API contracts for data access

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- Create API client infrastructure
- Define TypeScript interfaces for API responses
- Implement common utilities (pagination, error handling)
- Set up testing infrastructure

### Phase 2: Service Layer Implementation
- Create service modules for each API endpoint group
- Implement API service methods with proper typing
- Add caching for frequently accessed data

### Phase 3: Component Migration
- Migrate one dashboard section at a time:
  1. Agents section
  2. Events section
  3. Alerts section
  4. Metrics section
  5. Telemetry section
- Add loading states and error handling to each component

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
- End-to-end testing of migrated components
- Performance optimization
- Documentation updates

## Component Adaptation Strategy

For each dashboard component, we will:

1. **Analyze Current Implementation**
   - Identify database repositories currently in use
   - Document current data access patterns

2. **Map to API Resources**
   - Determine corresponding API endpoints
   - Address data structure differences

3. **Implement New Data Flow**
   - Replace repository calls with API service calls
   - Update state management

4. **Enhance UI**
   - Add loading states
   - Implement error handling
   - Add pagination where appropriate

5. **Test**
   - Verify functional parity
   - Check performance

## API vs Database Capabilities

Some adjustments will be needed due to differences between direct database access and API capabilities:

### Features Only Available via API
- Standardized pagination
- Consistent filtering options
- Server-side aggregated metrics
- Enhanced error information

### Features That May Need Adaptation
- Custom SQL queries will need to be replaced with API filtering
- Some complex joins may require multiple API calls
- Real-time updates may need to be implemented differently

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| API may not support all current UI features | Identify gaps early and plan for UI adaptations |
| Performance impact from API vs direct DB | Implement client-side caching for frequently accessed data |
| Breaking changes during migration | Migrate one component at a time with thorough testing |
| API availability | Add robust error handling and fallback states |

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. All direct database connections have been removed
2. All UI components function correctly with the API
3. End-to-end tests pass
4. Performance meets or exceeds previous implementation
5. Code is more maintainable with clear separation of concerns
