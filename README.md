- Dark/Light mode support
- Enterprise-grade security measures

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm 9.x or higher
- Git

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cylestio/cylestio-ui.git
   cd cylestio-ui
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   Edit `.env.local` with your configuration.

4. Run the development server:

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
npm test                 # Run unit tests
npm run test:coverage    # Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:e2e        # Run end-to-end tests
```

## üîí Security & Compliance

We take security seriously and follow industry best practices to protect your data and ensure compliance with major regulations.

### Security Measures

1. **Automated Security Checks**:

   - OWASP Dependency Check for known vulnerabilities
   - Trivy vulnerability scanner for container security
   - NodeJSScan for Node.js-specific security issues
   - npm audit for package vulnerabilities
   - ESLint security plugin for static code analysis

2. **Code Security**:

   - Strict TypeScript compilation
   - Security-focused ESLint rules
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - XSS prevention
   - CSRF protection
   - Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - HTTP Security Headers

3. **Authentication & Authorization**:

   - Strong password policies
   - Multi-factor authentication support
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Session management
   - JWT token security
   - Secure cookie handling

4. **Data Protection**:
   - Data encryption at rest and in transit
   - Secure database connections
   - PII data handling compliance
   - Data minimization practices
   - Regular security audits
   - Backup and recovery procedures

### Compliance

Our security practices are designed to meet the following standards:

1. **SOC 2**:

   - Security monitoring and logging
   - Access control policies
   - Change management procedures

   - Encryption requirements
   - Business Associate Agreements
   - Security risk assessments

4. **OWASP Top 10**:
   - Protection against injection attacks
   - Broken authentication prevention
   - Sensitive data exposure prevention
   - XML external entities (XXE) protection
   - Broken access control prevention
   - Security misconfiguration prevention
   - Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection
   - Insecure deserialization prevention
   - Using components with known vulnerabilities prevention
   - Insufficient logging & monitoring prevention

### Security Tools & Practices

- Continuous security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular penetration testing
- Vulnerability disclosure program
- Security incident response plan
- Regular security training for developers
- Code review security checklist
- Dependency update policy
- Security documentation
